# Password Generator -- Module 3 Project

## Purpose

The use of this webpage is to generate a secure password that is completely customized to what the user needs. The current options are:
-- Character Limit
-- Uppercase characters
-- Lowercase characters
-- Numbers
-- Special Characters

## How to use

In order to use this password generator, all you will have to do is click the "generate" button and then input how many characters you would like the password to obtain.
Then, you will need to select 'OK' or 'Cancel' to say whether or not you would like your password to contain uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers, or special characters.
Your password needs to contain one of the above - if you select 'cancel' to all of the options, it will force you to select 'OK' to at least one.
